        <p>
          Learning Habitat websites (collectively “Learning Habitat” in this
          document) refer to sites hosted on the learninghabitat.edu.sg,
          learning-habitat.org, lhtc.sg, and other related domains and
          subdomains thereof. This privacy policy describes how Learning Habitat
          uses and protects any information that you give us. We are committed
          to ensuring that your privacy is protected. If you provide us with
          personal information through Learning Habitat, you can be assured that
          it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
          <p>
            Like most website operators, Learning Habitat collects
            non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
            and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
            language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
            visitor request. Learning Habitat’s purpose in collecting
            non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
            Learning Habitat’s visitors use its website. From time to time,
            Learning Habitat may release non-personally-identifying information
            in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the
            usage of its website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning Habitat also collects potentially personally-identifying
            information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Learning Habitat
            does not use IP addresses to identify its visitors, however, and
            does not disclose such information, other than under the same
            circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
            information, as described below.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
          <p>
            Certain visitors to Learning Habitat choose to interact with
            Learning Habitat in ways that require Learning Habitat to gather
            personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
            information that Learning Habitat gathers depends on the nature of
            the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our forums to
            provide a username and email address.
          </p>
          <p>
            In each case, Learning Habitat collects such information only
            insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the
            visitor’s interaction with Learning Habitat. Learning Habitat does
            not disclose personally-identifying information other than as
            described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply
            personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may
            prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities,
            like requesting to get in touch with Learning Habitat Pte. Ltd.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of the information that is collected on Learning Habitat will be
            handled in accordance with GDPR legislation.

          <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
          <p>
            Learning Habitat discloses potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information only to those of project
            administrators, employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations
            that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on
            Learning Habitat’s behalf or to provide services available through
            Learning Habitat, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to
            others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
            organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using
            Learning Habitat, you consent to the transfer of such information to
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning Habitat will not rent or sell potentially
            personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to
            anyone. Other than to project administrators, employees,
            contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above,
            Learning Habitat discloses potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information only when required to do so by
            law, if you give permission to have your information shared, or when
            Learning Habitat believes in good faith that disclosure is
            reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Learning
            Habitat, third parties, or the public at large.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a registered user of a Learning Habitat website and have
            supplied your email address, Learning Habitat may occasionally send
            you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback,
            or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Learning
            Habitat and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate
            this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to
            a minimum.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one
            of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in
            order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us
            support other users. Learning Habitat takes all measures reasonably
            necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
            alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information.
